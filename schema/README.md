# Interchange format schema

This directory contains the schema for the Ars Magica 5th interchange format, defined in the [CUE][cuelang] language.

[cuelang]: https://cuelang.org/

## Versioning

Versioning is based on [SemVer][semver]. The schema itself only uses the MAJOR and MINOR number. The PATCH number is
left for parser packages versioning when they fix a bug with the parser code not being compliant with the `MAJOR.MINOR`
they implement. Each MAJOR version is defined in its own folder

[semver]: https://semver.org/
